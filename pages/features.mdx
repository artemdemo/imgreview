# ImgReview Features

ImgReview has number of unique features, let me show you some of them.

<Layout>
  <Cell span={4}>
    <h3>Add as many images as you need</h3>
    You can add as many images as you want. So it's never been that easy to compare
    several images side by side.
  </Cell>
  <Cell span={4}>
    <h3>Easy to add arrows and shapes</h3>
    The main feature that caused me to develop this app. You can add different shapes
    and (of course) arrows to make your point.
  </Cell>
  <Cell span={4}>
    <h3>Copy all</h3>
    You can copy your whole work to the clipboard in one click and then paste it
    in any app of your choosing: gmail, slack, docs, you name it.
  </Cell>
  <Cell span={4}>
    <h3>Sketchify</h3>
    Add "human" touch to your work. Sketchify will add a bit of imperfection to your
    shapes, making it unique.
  </Cell>
  <Cell span={4}>
    <h3>Add emotions</h3>
    You can easily add emojis. Also if you make them bigger, they will really stand
    out.
  </Cell>
</Layout>

export default ({ children }) => <Container>{children}</Container>;
