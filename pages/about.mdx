# About ImgReview

This project started with a simple idea - the ability to draw an arrow on a screenshot.
Yeah, I know it sounds silly, but this tool was always missing on my Linux machine.
So I decided to develop it myself.

You may ask - Why do I need it?
Imagine this: you're writing an email, and you want to show exactly what part of the screenshot you're referring to.
In this case, it's helpful to somehow mark it right?

Now, of course, you can open Paint or something similar and draw with your mouse, but it usually doesn't look good.
So I decided to solve it with my app.
And here we have it - ImgReview.
