## Development

You can install all packages locally, but it's not recommended.
The better way is to use dedicated docker for it.
All you need to do to start is to run following command:

```
$ docker-compose up
```

In order to stop you'll need:

```
$ docker-compose down
```

App will be available at http://localhost:8080/
