#About ImgReview

Hi guys,

This project started with a simple idea - the ability to draw an arrow on a screenshot.
Yeah, I know it sounds silly, but this tool was always missing on y Linux machine.
Imagine this: you're writing an email, and you want to show exactly what part of the screenshot you're referring to.
In this case it's helpful to somehow mark it right? :)

Now, of course you can open Paint or something similar and draw with your mouse, but it usually doesn't look good.
So I decided to solve it with my app.
And here we have it - ImgReview.
